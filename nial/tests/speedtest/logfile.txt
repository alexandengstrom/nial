Nial code executed in 0.536 seconds
Ruby code executed in 0.004 seconds

Nial is 147.31 times slower than Ruby

- This is the initial test

Nial code executed in 0.545 seconds
Ruby code executed in 0.005 seconds

Nial is 106.299 times slower than Ruby

- Implemented try-blocks so added this to the tests, seems like this made the difference smaller. I have not tried to improve the speed of the code yet.
